## About

**ngnix-ws-http** provides a starting point for building scalable backend systems that use Go for handling HTTP and WebSocket connections, with NGINX acting as a reverse proxy. The project is optimized for containerized deployment using Docker.

## Architecture

**ngnix-ws-http** follows a typical reverse proxy architecture:

- **Client:** (Browser or WebSocket client) sends HTTP or WebSocket requests.
- **NGINX:** Acts as a reverse proxy, handling client requests and forwarding them to the backend.
- **Go Backend Server:** Processes the requests and, if needed, connects to a database.
- **Database (Optional):** For persistent data storage, if your application requires it.

**Flow:**
1. Client → NGINX (HTTP/WebSocket)
2. NGINX → Go Backend Server (proxies the request)
3. Go Backend Server → Database (optional, for data storage)

## Features

- **NGINX Reverse Proxy:** Handles incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests, forwards them to the Go backend.
- **Go Backend:** High performance, scalable server for handling business logic.
- **Dockerized:** Easy to build, run, and deploy using Docker.
- **Extensible:** Add new endpoints, services, or connect to a database as needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) (version 1.18 or higher recommended)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/LikhithMar14/ngnix-ws-http.git
   cd ngnix-ws-http
   ```

2. **Build and run with Docker:**
   ```sh
   docker build -t ngnix-ws-http .
   docker run -p 8080:8080 ngnix-ws-http
   ```

3. **Or run locally (if Go is installed):**
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

- By default, the service is available at: `http://localhost:8080/`
- Use your browser or a WebSocket client to connect.
- Extend the backend code as needed for your application’s business logic.
